          <h2>Highway to Code</h2>
          <p>
            H2C is an university-level, free of charge training, duration 6 months.
            The partners of the project are Centria University of Applied Sciences (UAS), Oulu UAS,
            Kajaani UAS, Vaasa UAS, Jyv채skyl채 UAS and Turku UAS. The student seeks to study at the option that looks
            most interesting for his/her career. The aim is for the student to study at the chosen UAS, but it is also 
            possible for the student to choose courses from other partnering universities. Student performance is supported
            by local mentoring and it is possible to form study groups with other students of the same university.
          </p>
          <p>
            The target group of the training are the people interested in programming and the existing stereotypes 
            are aimed to be removed to respond the need of employees of the industry. The goal is especially to train 
            the immigrants and female, both underrepresented in this professional field. At the same time, fresh 
            perspectives are being brought to the industry: business-minded and user-driven future actors. Previous 
            work or study background in the non-IT sector is an opportunity that opens up a new kind of innovation and 
            user-orientation in product development.
