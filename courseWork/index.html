                <h2>Md Nuruzzaman Faruk</h2>
                <p>I came from Bangladesh in 2012 to kokkola. I studied in centria ammattikorkeakoulu. After finishing
                   my studies, I moved in Pori and I am living here almost 4 years. I live with my family here.</p>
                <p>I like to watch movie. Especially, science fiction and thriller. In my free time, I spend time with 
                    my family and sometimes I cook delicious food for them. I go for swimming and playing football and
                     badminton with my friends on weekends. After that, I don't forget to take sauna.
                </p>
                <p>Living in Finland is very secure and healthy. Because of the social system and clean environment. Here
                     are a lot of lake and beach. I don't miss to go there every summer. Most of the time, I go to the Yyteri 
                    beach. Finnish summer is very beautiful. Day is so long. That is why sleeping in night is very hard.
                    But it's ok for me. I use black curtain in my room. So, I don't face any problem to sleep.
                </p>
                <p>Every year I go to visit my country Bangladesh. But this year, I couldn't visit my country beacuse of the 
                    corona situation. Hope, I will go in this summer. By the time, pandemic situation will be better.</a>
                </p>   
                <p>Now I am doing "Highway 2 code" course. Course studies can be found<a href="highway-to-code-study.html #middle">here.</a> </p>
